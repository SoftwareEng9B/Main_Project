The scraper currently sends through a request to the website we pull data from
It then just gets the title of all the providers that pop up, the amount of people they serve, the area they serve, and a link to them
I will now make the scraper go to the link and extract the required info from there
Last thing would be to make it an API and make it be callable by the website.
You guys work on implementing this type of data on to the site and the structure, and wireframe and such
also Epstein didn't kill himself (stop marking me absent)
